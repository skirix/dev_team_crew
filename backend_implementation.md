The backend implementation plan for the task management app includes the following:

API Endpoints:
- Authentication (signup, login, password reset)
- Tasks (CRUD operations, categorization, prioritization, deadlines)
- Categories (CRUD operations)
- Teams (CRUD operations, member management)

Database Models:
- Users
- Tasks
- Categories
- Teams
- TeamMembers

Security Considerations:
- JWT-based authentication
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks
- Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Access control policies to ensure data access authorization
- Regular security monitoring and vulnerability patching

The backend will be designed as a microservices architecture, with separate services for authentication, tasks, categories, teams, and analytics. This ensures scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns, allowing the app to grow and adapt to future requirements.
