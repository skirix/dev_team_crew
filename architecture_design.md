The system architecture for the task management app includes the following:

Database Schema:
- Users
- Tasks
- Categories
- Teams
- TeamMembers

API Endpoints:
- Authentication (signup, login, password reset)
- Tasks (CRUD operations, categorization, prioritization, deadlines)
- Categories (CRUD operations)
- Teams (CRUD operations, member management)

Component Structure:
- Authentication (SignupForm, LoginForm, PasswordResetForm)
- Tasks (TaskList, TaskDetails, TaskForm, TaskCategory, TaskPriority, TaskDeadline, TaskNotifications)
- Teams (TeamList, TeamDetails, TeamForm, TeamMembers)
- Analytics (ProductivityDashboard, TaskMetrics, TeamPerformance)

The system will be built using a microservices architecture, with separate services for authentication, tasks, categories, teams, and analytics. The frontend will be a responsive web application built using a modern JavaScript framework.

Key features include user authentication, task management with categorization and prioritization, team collaboration, deadline notifications, and an analytics dashboard for productivity metrics.

This architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns, allowing the app to grow and adapt to future requirements.
